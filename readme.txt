To run the Pac-man program, first download the entire Pac-man (cs499pacman) folder to your
computer desktop.

The important parts of this folder include the bower components which contains the Crafty game library download, the javascript files which consists of four separate files, and a lib folder which contains the sprite images and pac-man logo which are needed to display the characters in the game.
Lastly, you should see a file called index.html inside cs499pacman. Double clicking this file will run the program in the browser.
